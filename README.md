# Implementation of a simplified C-compiler

The compiler was implemented in C++ using Flex and Yacc-Bison. It was accomplished as an assignment in one of my sessional courses in undergradute studies in BUET.  
Different parts of the implementations are as follows:  
  
-Symbol Table Implementation  
  
-Lexical Analyzer Implementation 
  
-Syntax Analyzer Implementation 
  
-Intermediate Representation Generator Implementation
